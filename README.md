**openssl-native-certs** allows [OpenSSL](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl) to use the
platform's native certificate store when operating as a TLS client.

This is supported on Windows, macOS and Linux:

- On Windows, certificates are loaded from the system certificate store.
  The [`schannel`](https://github.com/steffengy/schannel-rs) crate is used to access
  the Windows certificate store APIs.
- On macOS, certificates are loaded from the keychain.
  The user, admin and system trust settings are merged together as documented
  by Apple.  The [`security-framework`](https://github.com/kornelski/rust-security-framework)
  crate is used to access the keystore APIs.
- On Linux and other UNIX-like operating systems, the
  [`openssl-probe`](https://github.com/alexcrichton/openssl-probe) crate is used to discover
  the filename of the system CA bundle.
